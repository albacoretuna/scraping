# Description
A dirty bunch of phantomjs scripts for scraping. 

## Usage 
I'm using: 
  * casperjs 1.1.0-beta3 
  * phantomjs 1.9.0
All the scripts so far are in casper folder.  
Just running 
  casperjs scriptname.js
Creates an output file in the casper/output folder named somehow like the website the script is supposed to scrape. 

### Notes
  * for B&M Uk, the script iterates over all the cities in UK, it takes about 3 minutes, and sometimes it fails, be patient. 
  * Sorry that everything is so messy, I'll clean up when I can.
